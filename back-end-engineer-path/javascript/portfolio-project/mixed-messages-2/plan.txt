Plan and design for Mixed Messages 2

- Create a random text generator that will create a song as follows:
- Randomly choose a genre (10 options)
    Rock
    Pop
    Metal
    Jazz
    Punk
    Electronic
    Country
    Blues
    Hip Hop
    R&B
` Randomly choose a key (17 options):
    Ab
    A
    A#
    Bb
    B
    C
    C#
    Db
    D
    D#
    Eb
    E
    F
    F#
    Gb
    G
    G#
- Decide whether it's major or minor
- Choose the chords (from II-VII)
- Decide whether the third chord will be a 7 chord or not
- Choose a tempo between 90 and 180 at increments of 3bpm

How to do:
- Create an array per choice
- Use Math.floor(Math.random * [array length]) to create a random number to pull from the array
- setup secondary array for randomly generated answers and queue up a string
- return concatenation of all strings
